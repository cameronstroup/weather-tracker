# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
This is a web based app that I buitl to show the user the weather of his/her desired city. 

Enter in your city of choice and select search to view the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index for that city at the current time. Upon the search, the dashobard will also display the weather, temperature and hummidity forecast for the next five(5) days. 

The uv index will be either green, yellow, or red depending of the intensitiy of the current index

Previous searches are saved in localStorage, however still have bugs that I am working on but wanted to turn something in 

## Built With
